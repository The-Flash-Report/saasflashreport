# Product Requirements Document: SaaS Flash Report Site

## Introduction/Overview

This project creates the **SaaS Flash Report site** (saasflashreport.com) as part of the broader Flash Report portfolio expansion. The SaaS Flash Report extends the successful AI Flash Report platform architecture to serve SaaS professionals, founders, investors, and B2B software decision-makers with daily curated SaaS industry intelligence.

**Problem Statement:** SaaS professionals and B2B software decision-makers need a dedicated source for daily SaaS industry news covering funding rounds, product launches, enterprise software developments, and pricing changes. While general tech news exists, there's no focused daily digest specifically for the SaaS ecosystem.

**Goal:** Create a high-quality SaaS news site leveraging the proven AI Flash Report architecture, template system, and Flash Summary Component while targeting the distinct professional audience in the SaaS and enterprise software markets.

## Goals

2. **SaaS Audience Targeting:** Capture SaaS professionals, founders, investors, and B2B software decision-makers
3. **Technical Replication:** Leverage existing universal template system and Flash Summary Component for rapid deployment
4. **Content Quality:** Provide SaaS-specific, actionable daily summaries using Perplexity AI with custom SaaS-focused prompts
5. **Portfolio Integration:** Enable cross-discovery to other Flash Report sites through strategic linking
6. **Independent Operations:** Site operates independently with separate domain, analytics, and deployment
