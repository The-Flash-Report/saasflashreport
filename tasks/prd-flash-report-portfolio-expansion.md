# Product Requirements Document: Flash Report Portfolio Expansion

## Introduction/Overview

This project extends the successful AI Flash Report platform (aiflashreport.com) by creating **6 additional niche sites** targeting high-value verticals: Health, Tech, Fitness, Travel, Startup, and SaaS. Together with the existing AI Flash Report, this creates a **7-site portfolio**. Each new site will replicate the proven AI Flash Report architecture using the universal template system, with niche-specific branding, content sources, and Perplexity AI flash summaries.

**Problem Statement:** While AI Flash Report successfully serves AI news consumers, there are untapped audiences in adjacent verticals who would benefit from the same fast, curated daily news format. These audiences have distinct content needs and preferences that justify dedicated sites.

**Goal:** Create a portfolio of 7 Flash Report sites (1 existing + 6 new) that leverage the proven template and Flash Summary Component while targeting distinct professional audiences in AI, Health, Tech, Fitness, Travel, Startup, and SaaS markets.

## Goals

1. **Portfolio Expansion:** Build 6 additional independent, high-quality news sites using proven AI Flash Report architecture (creating 7-site portfolio total)
2. **Audience Diversification:** Capture distinct professional audiences in each vertical (health optimization, tech professionals, fitness enthusiasts, travelers, startup ecosystem, SaaS operators)
3. **Technical Replication:** Leverage existing universal template system and Flash Summary Component for rapid deployment
4. **Content Quality:** Provide niche-specific, actionable daily summaries using Perplexity AI with custom prompts
5. **Cross-Portfolio Discovery:** Enable users to discover other sites in the portfolio through strategic cross-linking
6. **Independent Operations:** Each site operates independently with separate domains, analytics, and GitHub repositories
