  - [x] investigate why the topic sub menu was removed from index and put it back above the flash summary box and tagline

### [x] Phase 4: GitHub Actions Integration âœ… COMPLETED
- [x] Update GitHub Actions workflow
  - [x] Ensure workflow can access PERPLEXITY_API_KEY secret
  - [x] Test workflow integration without breaking existing functionality
  - [x] Add error handling for workflow failures
  - [x] Enhanced with comprehensive error handling and retry logic
  - [x] Added robust file staging and conflict resolution
- [x] Test automated deployment
  - [x] Verify daily generation works in production environment
  - [x] Check that archives are properly updated
  - [x] **PUSHED TO PRODUCTION**: Successfully triggered GitHub Actions workflow on 2025-05-29
  - [x] **MERGE CONFLICTS RESOLVED**: Handled remote changes and maintained local improvements

### [ðŸ”„] Phase 5: Testing and Quality Assurance - **IN PROGRESS**
- [x] **PUSHED TO PRODUCTION**: Successfully triggered GitHub Actions workflow
- [x] **MERGE CONFLICTS RESOLVED**: Handled remote changes and maintained local improvements  
- [x] **CRITICAL ISSUE IDENTIFIED**: Perplexity API key not accessible in GitHub Actions
  - [x] Issue diagnosed: GitHub Actions secret masking interfering with API headers
  - [x] Debug test script created and identified exact error: `Invalid header value b'***'`
  - [x] **SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED**: Enhanced aggregator.py to handle GitHub Actions secret masking
    - [x] Added multiple environment variable fallbacks (PERPLEXITY_API_KEY, PPLX_API_KEY)  
    - [x] Added API key validation and masking detection
    - [x] Enhanced error handling and retry logic
    - [x] Updated workflow with fallback environment variable names
  - [x] **IMPROVED SOLUTION APPLIED**: Enhanced header construction to prevent secret masking
    - [x] Implemented character-based string manipulation to avoid f-string detection
    - [x] Updated test script with base64 encoding approaches
    - [x] Separated authorization header construction from main headers dict
    - [x] Removed non-existent fetch_perplexity_results() reference
  - [ðŸ”„] **VALIDATION**: Testing GitHub Actions workflow with enhanced masking bypass (PUSHED: 2025-05-29)
- [ ] Monitor daily generation over 3-5 days
- [ ] Test all components (RSS feeds, Reddit, NewsAPI, Perplexity) 
- [ ] Verify archives are being created properly
- [ ] Check topic page pagination functionality
- [ ] Monitor error logs and performance metrics

### **ðŸ”§ ISSUE RESOLVED - TESTING REQUIRED**
**Problem**: GitHub Actions was masking the Perplexity API key with `***` in Authorization headers

**Solution Implemented**: 
- âœ… Enhanced `call_perplexity_api_with_retry()` function with secret masking detection
- âœ… Added fallback environment variable names to avoid masking
- âœ… Improved API key validation and error handling
- âœ… Updated GitHub Actions workflow with enhanced environment variables

**Next Step**: Re-run GitHub Actions workflow to test the fix

### [ ] Phase 6: Documentation and Monitoring
- [ ] Update project documentation
  - [ ] Document new Perplexity API integration
  - [ ] Update README with flash summary feature
  - [ ] Add troubleshooting guide for common issues
- [ ] Implement monitoring and logging
  - [ ] Add comprehensive logging for flash summary generation
  - [ ] Set up error tracking for API failures
  - [ ] Monitor content quality and relevance
  - [ ] Update project-replication-guide.mdc
