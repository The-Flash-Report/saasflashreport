# Product Requirements Document: AI Content Keyword-Mapped Pages

## Introduction/Overview

This feature extends the existing AI Flash Report aggregation platform to create specialized content pages that filter and display AI-related news based on specific keywords. The system will automatically generate dedicated pages for company-specific news (OpenAI, Google AI, ChatGPT) and topic-specific content (machine learning, deep learning, AI research), while also supporting manually curated highlight pages.

**Problem Statement:** Users currently need to scan through all aggregated content to find news about specific AI companies or topics. This creates friction and reduces engagement for users interested in particular areas of AI development.

**Goal:** Create a series of focused, keyword-filtered pages that allow users to quickly access relevant AI content based on their specific interests, improving user experience and increasing page views.

## Goals

1. **Automated Content Filtering:** Implement keyword-based filtering to automatically populate company and topic-specific pages
2. **Improved User Navigation:** Provide clear pathways for users to find content relevant to their interests
3. **SEO Enhancement:** Create multiple landing pages targeting specific AI-related search terms
4. **Content Discoverability:** Increase engagement by surfacing relevant content more effectively
5. **Scalable Architecture:** Build a system that can easily accommodate new keyword categories and pages
