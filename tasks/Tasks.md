# SaaS Flash Report - Current Tasks

## Phase 3: Immediate QA Fixes (IN PROGRESS)

### Critical Issues - Next Up
- [ ] **PRIORITY 1**: Add Flash Summary Component to index.html (missing daily summary section)
- [ ] **PRIORITY 2**: Fix archive page H1 sizing to match index.html consistency
- [ ] **PRIORITY 3**: Update topic page taglines - remove "Artificial Intelligence News at Machine Speed" → "Software Intelligence, Business Speed"

### Template Consistency Issues
- [x] Verify H1 consistency across all pages (some pages may have different H1 styling e.g archive). Index.html has the correct h1.
- [x] Ensure topic pages have title case headlines (not ALL CAPS) - Aggregator configured correctly, old content will be replaced on next content update
- [x] Ensure topic pages have correct newsletter form configured for Netlify (use the one from index.html)
- [x] Update newsletter form text from "AI enthusiasts" to "SaaS professionals" - Template configured correctly, old static pages will be replaced on next content update
- [x] Fix any remaining color inconsistencies (should be blue #3B82F6, not red #cc0000) - Templates correctly configured with blue colors, old static pages will be replaced on next content update

### Other
- [x] Verify this plausible script is present: <script defer data-domain="saasflashreport.com" src="https://plausible.io/js/script.outbound-links.js"></script> - Template correctly configured, old static pages will be replaced on next content update
- [x] Clean up project of extraneous files and files related to the old AI site

### Content Issues
- [x] Verify all topic pages have SaaS-appropriate content (not AI content) - Removed 40+ AI-specific pages, updated remaining with SaaS branding
- [x] Check navigation dropdown has correct SaaS topic categories
- [x] Ensure all meta descriptions reference SaaS, not AI - Updated template with SaaS-focused descriptions
