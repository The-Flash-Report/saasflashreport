**AI Shockwave: Anthropic CEO Warns Half of Entry-Level Jobs Could Disappear Within Five Years as Governments Downplay Threat**

**Today's Top Stories:**

- Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei warns that AI could eliminate up to 50% of entry-level white-collar jobs within five years, urging greater transparency as governments and companies underplay the risk of mass unemployment[^1][^6].
- Saudi-backed Humain launches a \$10 billion AI fund, aiming to make the Kingdom a global AI hub and securing major tech deals with Nvidia, AMD, AWS, and Qualcomm[^2].
- OpenAI plans to move beyond screens with an “ambient computer layer,” acquiring Jony Ive’s AI device startup io for nearly \$6.5 billion to create more personal, seamless AI experiences[^4].

**Flash Insight:**
Anthropic's stark warning signals a pivotal moment for the AI industry: while rapid advances promise unprecedented productivity and breakthroughs, the risk of large-scale job displacement is now immediate and tangible. As leading players accelerate innovation and funding, the pressure mounts on governments and companies to address the societal impact of automation before it reshapes the global workforce.
